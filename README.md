# quill-highlight-example-001
A simple public Quill project, useful for anyone who wants to learn a little more about this tool (the code is all commented). This project introduces the use of a toolbar with text highlighting tools.

Instructions:

1.  Do git clone or download it to your computer.
2.  Make sure you are connected to the internet as the project uses CDN libraries.
3.  Open the HTML page named index.html.
4.  Select any portion of text to appear on the toolbar.
5.  Use the options on the toolbar.
